            <p>The stage is set for one of the biggest main events in WrestleMania history—<strong>Roman Reigns vs. Cody Rhodes</strong> for the <strong>Undisputed WWE Universal Championship</strong>. The Tribal Chief, Roman Reigns, has dominated WWE for over three years, but Cody Rhodes is looking to finish his story and claim the title that his family has never held.</p>
            
            <h3>How We Got Here</h3>
            <p>The rivalry between Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes has been brewing since last year’s WrestleMania, where Cody fell short of dethroning Reigns. This year, The American Nightmare gets another shot, and the WWE Universe is buzzing with anticipation.</p>
            
            <h3>Roman Reigns: The Tribal Chief’s Reign of Dominance</h3>
            <p>Roman Reigns has been the face of WWE, holding the championship for over 1,200 days. With The Bloodline by his side, he has defeated every major challenger. However, cracks are starting to form within his faction, and Cody Rhodes is ready to exploit them.</p>
            
            <h3>Cody Rhodes: Finishing the Story</h3>
            <p>Cody Rhodes’ return to WWE has been about legacy and redemption. He won the 2024 Royal Rumble, securing another opportunity to challenge Reigns. The question remains—can Cody do what so many others have failed to accomplish?</p>
            
            <h3>What’s at Stake?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Roman Reigns’ Legacy:</strong> A win solidifies him as one of the greatest champions in WWE history.</li>
                <li><strong>Cody Rhodes’ Redemption:</strong> A victory means completing his family’s wrestling legacy.</li>
                <li><strong>The Future of WWE:</strong> Will The Bloodline continue its dominance, or will a new era begin?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>The WWE Universe is divided—some believe Roman Reigns’ historic reign should continue, while others are rallying behind Cody Rhodes. One thing is certain: WrestleMania is shaping up to be an unforgettable event. <strong>Will Cody finish his story, or will Roman Reigns remain the Head of the Table?</strong> We’ll find out soon!</p>
